# lab4

The requirements for the lab:

Name the program giftlist.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

Santa Claus allegedly keeps lists of those who are naughty and those who are nice. On the naughty list are the names of those who will get coal in their stockings. On the nice list are those who will receive gifts. Each object in this list contains a name (an instance of Name, as defined in Appendix B) and a list of that person's (an instance of an ADT list).

Program must compile and run.
All inputs are strings.
Only do the nice list, not the naughty list.
User will enter names until empty string denoting no more names.
Each name will be followed by one or more gifts.
After names entered display contents of the name list and each gift list.
